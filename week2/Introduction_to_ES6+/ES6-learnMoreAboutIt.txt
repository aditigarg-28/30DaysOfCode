var, let and const keyword:
-> When we declare a variable with var, it is declared globally and is declared locally inside a function.
-> Whereas when we declare variable with let keyword, it,'s scope is limited to a block in which it is declared. 
-> const keyword has all the features of let but it is read only ie we can not reassign a variable declared with const keyword.

Object.freeze() is used toprevent data Mutation.

Rest Operator is used to create a function that take variable number of arguments. It is denoted by 3 Dots(...)

Spread Operator looks just like Rest Operator ie 3 Dots(...) but it is used to extend an already existing array or it spreads out an array into individual parts.

Destructing Assignment with the Rest Operator to reassign Array Elements
const list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
const [ , , ...arr] = list;
console.log(arr); -output: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
const [ a, b, ...arr1] = list;
console.log(a,b,arr1); -output: 1,2

We can import and export code from one file to another.
demo.js file:
export const name="aditi"

index.js file:
import { name } from "./demo"  //importing name variable from demo 
console.log(name);

we can import everything from a file using *.
import * as abc from "capitalize_strings";
//here abc is the object name which is used to access the code which we have imported.

Exporting a default export- This is a fallback export and it is often used when we only want to export one thing from a file.
export default function subtract(x,y) {return x - y;}

Importing a default export- It is similar to previos import, the only difference is that we don't use curly braces while importing default export:
import subtract from "math_functions";
subtract(7,4);
